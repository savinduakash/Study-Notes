## Quick Summary

A **hard link** is an additional name for an existing file in the filesystem.  
Unlike a symbolic link, a hard link points directly to the file's **inode**, so the file data remains accessible even if the original file is deleted.

**Key points:**
- Cannot link directories (except root/with special privileges)
- Exists on the same filesystem
- Shares the same inode number with the original file

## Syntax

```bash
ln [OPTION] TARGET LINK_NAME
```
# Create a hard link
```
ln file.txt hardlink.txt
```
# Verify both files share the same inode
```
ls -li file.txt hardlink.txt
```
